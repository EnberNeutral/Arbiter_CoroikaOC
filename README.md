## Arbiter

**They/Them (Libragender) | Arbitration Committee Member**

Created this OC by mixing two Coroika characters together (Army and 8bit) like a fusion. The rest of their lore as an arbiter/mediator started just because I was pissed off at the leniency towards Team Blue's behavior in matches; they let nudity, misuse of weaponry or equipment, and food out in these matches when it should be forbidden. Also, having your antagonist be part of an committee, which has genuine influence and an impressive amount of control over your matches, is a meancing concept for our protagonist team. Team Blue loves fun, but when you're breaking regulations through unmoderated and reckless whimsy, how do you respond to a strict organization that'll penalize every careless mistake?

Trivia/Facts:
- Arbiter is currently the strictest member of the committee, a result of their passion for debates and their high standards.
- They are neurodivergent, but it's only been publicly stated that they're autistic. (I wouldn't mind y'all guessing based off of the info here :D)
- They have a friend named Vince; he's part of an uptight, competitive community.
- When they were younger, Arbiter fixated on Army, and even saw the match between Team Orange and Team Blue. This fixation is still obvious, since they still dress and use similar weapons as their idol.
- Arbiter has major, disdainful sentiments towards Team Blue; specifically Goggles and Bobble Hat. They are a lot harsher towards them, occasionally to the point where the penalties are unfair and unjustified.
- They may also look up to Team Emperor, but mostly due to the high standards Emperor had set for everyone and the tactics the team applied.
- The album TRUST CEREMONY and the song Split! by Jhariah are associated with this OC.

**The rest is left up to you to ask, or for me show through interactions/rp, since I rather not infodump way too much.**
